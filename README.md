# API Connect Gateway

This repository contains the code for the API Connect Gateway project, which is designed to facilitate seamless integration with various APIs. It's structured into two main parts: a frontend application and a backend service.

## Project Structure

- **`frontend/`**: This directory houses the client-side application, responsible for the user interface and interaction.
- **`backend/`**: This directory contains the server-side logic and API handling, serving as the core of the gateway.

## Getting Started

More detailed instructions on how to set up and run both the frontend and backend components will be added here soon. Stay tuned!
