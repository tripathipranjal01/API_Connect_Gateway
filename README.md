# API Connect Gateway

This repository contains the code for the API Connect Gateway project, which is designed to facilitate seamless integration with various APIs. It's structured into two main parts: a frontend application and a backend service.

## Project Structure

- **`frontend/`**: This directory houses the client-side application, responsible for the user interface and interaction.
- **`backend/`**: This directory contains the server-side logic and API handling, serving as the core of the gateway.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or Yarn) installed for the frontend, and any necessary runtime for your backend (e.g., Python, Node.js) if applicable.

### 1. Backend Setup

Navigate to the `backend/` directory and install dependencies, then start the server.

```bash
cd backend/
npm install  # Or 'pip install -r requirements.txt' if Python
npm start    # Or your specific backend start command (e.g., 'python app.py')
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

Navigate to the `frontend/` directory, install dependencies, and then start the development server.

```bash
cd frontend/
npm install  # Or 'yarn install'
npm start    # Or 'yarn start'
```

Once both are running, your frontend application should be accessible, and it will communicate with the local backend.
